My dotfiles
===========

Just a small selection of configuration files and scripts with no special
selection. Might be someone finds this useful, other than that this is mostly
to have a place to have them uploaded.

---

Reorganizing the structure of this dotfiles repo to conform with
homesick/homeshick, a script that does symlinking of your repo'd dotfiles into
your actual home. Everything in this repo in home/ will be symlinked into $HOME
just like it is, so the files have to be in the right hierarchy as they should
appear in $HOME. Everything in the repo's root or other folders will not be
linked, like this README.
